title: Week 2 Review (Objects, Functions, and Expressions)
week: 2
date: 2022-04-08

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great start to your quarter and that you are enjoying learning more about CS and Python!
* This week, some of the topics that we discussed in class and during the labs included:  
    - Basic data types (`int`, `float`, `str`) and how to get them from `input()`
    - How to use math expressions and the `math` module in Python
    - Functions and their uses in programming
    - Formatted strings in Python
    - Different kinds of errors 
    - and much more!
* As mentioned in the [Syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#online-class): this class "_require synchronous interactions and active participation._" 
    - This week, during class, we worked through two labs/activities (LAs 2.17 and 2.18 in zyBooks).
    - In the lab, just like in class, we focused on writing functions, including the reasons for doing so. TAs discussed it, even asking for the total number of lines of code that we'd need to write if we didn't write the function.
    - We had our first quiz (Quiz 1) and the results have been released on Gauchospace. 
        - Quizzes are announced in advance (i.e., during the previous week and/or previous class time). 
        - Any regrade requests should be submitted through a form that's linked in the quiz description on Gauchospace.
* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ⏩ icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

ℹ️ Pay attention to the **Troubleshooting** section of the zyLabs, especially, the **checkpoint** labs - we aggregate the most common issues that we see in the office hours and on Piazza, and add them there with the suggested solutions.
If you run into an issue, check those sections first.


## ⏰ Week 2 and 3 - Due dates and Deadlines ⏰
As you can see on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-2), the due dates this week included:
* ⏰  **Thursday 10PM**: complete the zyLabs with the word "Checkpoint" in their title + the zyBooks activities mentioned in the ["Deadlines extended" announcement]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/announcements/).
* ⏰  **Sunday 10PM**: Week 2 reflection - the link to it is available under the Week 2 tab on Gauchospace
* Work on completing Week 2 lab activities (LA02) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) (you can watch the Week 1 Th class recording to see how to make a new post/post a follow-up)

The deadlines **next week** are:
* ⏰ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA03**
* ⏰ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA03**
* ⏰ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA02** - all non-optional Week 2 zyLabs
* ⏰ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA03 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 3 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ⏰ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace


## ➡️    Staying on Track

By the end of this Sunday: Ideally, you should be finished with PAs for Chapter 3 and done with the CAs for its first 4-5 sections.

🔮 [Looking ahead to Week 3]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-3), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Do not try to memorize everything! 💎
    - We will work with strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries a lot in the following weeks, so we will revisit them again.
    - Get a sense of what each data structure (the data type) does by noticing similarities and differences.
    - The "📎 Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.
* Write down anything that's unclear and questions to ask during class
* Carefully read through the guide for [Translating Lab Instructions Into Code]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/labtocode). 

If you haven't already done so, please complete the action items that we posted for you in our first announcement (you can see it in the ["Getting Started" post on the website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/announcements/) or under the Week 1 tab on Gauchospace. 
    - We specifically recommend [creating an email filter for CSW8 messages]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success#create-an-email-filter) to make sure that you see the announcements and emails from us in your primary inbox.

If you ever have any questions, please, _first_ consult the [course syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about) and the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq). A lot of [course structure, helpful hints, and expectations]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#weekly-pattern-and-planning-your-work) are also outlined for you on that page.

> <span style="color:orange"> Your success in this course will largely depend on how carefully you read and follow the instructions.</span>

## Looking ahead in Week 2

As part of following the instructions, this week, we were using f-strings and the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block (for the main program) without diving deeper into how they work. The goal was just to use these concepts by **following the provided pattern**, which is an important skill.

In zyBooks' Week 3 sections (_Section 3.10 String formatting_ and _3.11 Alternative string formatting_), you will get more details on and practice with the f-strings. 

If you are eager to learn more about functions, then you can jump ahead to Week 5 in zyBooks. 
The easy-to-start sections include: 
* _5.1_ (the basics), 
* _5.4_ (reasons for defining functions), 
* _5.5_ (writing math functions), 
* _5.8_ (common errors),
* _5.9_ (scope - local vs. global variables). 
Section 5.11 discusses the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.

Week 5 is also when we will begin to work with Gradescope - since we are not using it yet, don't worry about it.

In closing, here's something fun that you might explore if you are a fan of manga: [Manga Out of the Box](https://artsandculture.google.com/project/manga), a new offering from Google Arts and Culture.  You can even draw your own manga character with help from Machine Learning (ML).

We wish you a nice weekend!

Prof. K and the mentors
