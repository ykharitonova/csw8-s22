Dear all,

Hope you’re having a great time thus far! 
We have been really happy to meet those of you who stopped by the office hours, so don’t hesitate to join us even if it’s just to say “Hello” :-)

Before we dive into Week 4, we wanted to take a step back to review what happened in Week 3.
If there is anything from Week 3 that you are still unsure about, especially, regarding indexing and string formatting, make sure that you review and clarify it. The material in this class will begin to build on itself a lot more after Week 4, so make sure that you are comfortable with what we've covered so far. 

* As mentioned in the [Syllabus]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#online-class): this class "_require synchronous interactions and active participation._" 
    - Make sure that you've installed the **iClicker app** and followed the link at the top of the Gauchospace page to create your account and add our class. 
        - We added the notes about how to register and how to join the class to the [Section 3.22 in zyBooks](https://learn.zybooks.com/zybook/UCSBCMPSCW8KharitonovaSpring2022/chapter/3/section/22) (**Week 3: Student activities and notes**).
        - At the end of this week, we will update the Syllabus to clarify the iClicker policies.
    - During class and lab, we discussed different data structures such as:
        - Tuples (Immutable Data Store), 
        - Sets (Mutable Data Store),
        - Lists (Mutable Data Store),
        - Dictionaries (Mutable Data Store)
        - Indexing in ordered data structures and dictionaries
        - Modifying lists and dictionaries
        - Various useful built-in operations in data structures
        - String Formatting
        - Binary Numbers
    - We had our second quiz (Quiz 2) and the results have been released on Gauchospace. 
        - Quizzes are announced in advance during the class (i.e., during the previous week and/or previous class time). 
        - Any regrade requests should be submitted through a form that's linked in the quiz description on Gauchospace.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ⏩ icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

## ⏰ Week 4 - Due dates and Deadlines ⏰

_Keep in mind that your grades have to be manually transferred to Gauchospace, so the synchronization is not instant. 
Your grades for each week's activities will be updated on Fridays at 10am. We will process the extensions on Saturdays by 10 am - you will receive a confirmation when your extension was processed and the grade was updated._

The Week 4 deadlines are:
* ⏰ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA04**
* ⏰ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA04**
* ⏰ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA03** - all non-optional Week 3 zyLabs
* ⏰ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA04 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 4 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ⚠️  **Friday, April 22** is the final day to drop this class without a W. Note that you will **not** be able to [change this course to P/NP later]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/about#note-about-pnp).
* ⏰ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace


## ➡️    Staying on Track

* Work on completing this week's lab activities (LA03) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) 

🔮 [Looking ahead to Week 4]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-4), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Get the iClicker app ready to be used in class.
* Understand the flow of the program based on the results of Boolean conditions. Practice writing `assert` statements. 💎
    - We will work with branching and `assert` statements a lot more in the following weeks.
    - The "📎 Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.
    - If the "Instructor note" in zyBooks is asking you a question, work through it - chances are, it might appear on a quiz.
* Write down anything that's unclear and questions to ask during class.

## New Resource for Troubleshooting

We have added various 🐛 [Debugging scenarios and solutions]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/debug) to our course website. 
We will be further expanding it with the errors and examples that you submit on Piazza to the pinned "Errordeck" post.
We hope that you'll find it to be a helpful resource.

A lot of [course structure, helpful hints, and expectations]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/faq/#weekly-pattern-and-planning-your-work) are also outlined for you on that page.

Just a reminder: you can find these announcements on the [main course website]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/) as well as under the [**Instructor Announcements** on Gauchospace](https://gauchospace.ucsb.edu/courses/mod/forum/view.php?id=1014718) (which is supposed to email it to you automatically).

✨ LAST, but certainly, not the LEAST - Here’s an interesting perspective on [How to actually ENJOY studying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Chsfe7Ic8&ab_channel=UnJadedJade) (12-minute video). We'll be asking you for your top 3 on this week's reflection, so start thinking about it now. ;-)

We are looking forward to a productive week ahead!

Prof. K and the mentors
