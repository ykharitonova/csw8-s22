# 🎲 Week 6: Repeating and Iterating (Loops)

Dear all,

We hope you all had a great week! With 40% of the course in front of us, we hope that you are all looking forward to taking your knowledge to the next level!

- This week, we discussed one of the most important and interesting topics - loops! 
- We deconstructed the two types of loop constructs (`while`, `for`) and their differences, and how they iterate through a range of numbers or even container types. 
- We saw the `range()` function in action and discussed how to write loops using the various forms of range: `range(stop)`, `range(start, stop)`, `range(start, stop, step)`.
- We also had a party with our tidepool characters to clarify how the nested `for` loops work.
- During labs, we went over some concepts reviewed in class such as `while` and `for` loop constructs and how to use the `range()` function for a container type such as a list. We also went through the concept of nested loops.

* The slides and class recordings as well as the videos from the class and lab sections are posted on Gauchospace (look for the ⏩ icon; use your <span style="color:red">**UCSB address**</span> - we won't be granting access to personal gmail accounts.)

## ⏰ Week 6 and 7 - Due dates and Deadlines ⏰

As you can see on the [Calendar]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-6), the remaining due dates this week include:
* ⏰  **Thursday 10PM**: 
    - Checkpoint labs for Week 5 on Gradescope - we've opened up that assignment so you get more practice submitting your code on Gradescope
    - Checkpoint labs for Week 6 on zyBooks - the labs are designed to guide you through the solution via their hints
* Not a deadline but a reminder that we have a review session with Prof. K **this Friday at 11am**. She'll stay for as long as there are students or until 3 hours have lapsed, whichever comes first. :-)
* ⏰  **Sunday 10PM**: Weekly reflection - the link to it is available under the **Week 6 tab** on Gauchospace

The deadlines **next week** are:
* ⏰ **Monday 10PM** Due: **PA07**
* ⏰ **Tuesday 10PM** Due: **CA07**
* ⏰ **Wednesday 10PM** Due: **LA06** - all non-optional Week 6 zyLabs
* ⏰ **Thursday 10PM** Due: **LA07 CHECKPOINT labs** - all Week 7 zyLabs with "checkpoint" in the title
* ⏰ **Sunday 10PM** Due: **Weekly reflection** that will be posted on Gauchospace


## ➡️    Staying on Track
* Continue practicing with the IDE / IDLE to ensure that you can create new files and are [**not** relying on the Python shell]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/ide#warning)
* Stop by the review session **this Friday at 11am** to ask questions or just chat. :-)
* Work on completing this week's lab activities (LA06) _before Wednesday 9am_ - ask for clarifications during the [office hours]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/schedule/), lab sessions, or post your questions on [Piazza]({{site.aux_links.Piazza}}) 
* By the end of Sunday: Ideally, you should be finished with PAs for Chapter 7 and done with the CAs for its first 4-5 sections.

🔮 [Looking ahead to Week 7]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/calendar#week-7), your tasks for the upcoming days are:
* Review your notes from Week 3 about Lists and Dictionaries! 💎
    - In-place modification and modification of a copy of a list is an important distinction.
    - Pay close attention to iterating through the list vs. the dictionary.
    - Keep track of the square brackets / parentheses when nesting lists / dictionaries 
    - Make sure that you work through the examples of how to index nested structures.
    - Create your own example of how to nest lists inside a dictionary and dictionaries in a list - share it on a forum, so others can practice with it too.
    - The "📎 Quick access" notes within the zyBooks sections point you to the resources you will definitely need to reference, so make a note of them.
* Write down anything that's unclear and if you have any questions to ask during class

## Your TO-DO before Week 7
* meet Week 6 deadlines (see above)
* follow the "Staying on Track" advice above
* try the **Practice Gradescope Quiz** ==>>> ⚠️  start on Gauchospace to get your version, then head over to Gradescope to submit your file there
* take good care of yourself (check out the ["Mindfulness Daily at Work" post on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/l1ca0xuimie3f9?cid=243) if you want to join Prof K on a 40-day mindfulness journey)

## ➡️    Resources

* If you are still confused about if __name__ == “__main__”, have a look at [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/if-name-main-python-example) to read more about it (🐍 snake picture alert!). We encourage you to use a template to help you with the function definition and the `if __name__ == "__main__":` in your main.py file.
* Use [Python Tutor to visualize your code](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) and let us know if you have other [debugging tips]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/ref/debug#quick-debugging-tips) that would be helpful to share with others.


We are happy to see that you are working hard and making your way through the difficult weeks of the quarter. Let’s keep the spirit up. We are here to help you with anything you need -- don’t hesitate to reach out to us through piazza or attend our office hours during the week. We hope you’ll also get to recharge yourselves over the weekend :). Wishing you all a lovely weekend!



Prof. K and the mentors
